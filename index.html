    <p>Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in
    the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and
    shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the
    same family. Divided among several subfamilies, they are a form
    taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of
    all descendants of a single common ancestral species), since
    swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly
    aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea
    water.</p>
